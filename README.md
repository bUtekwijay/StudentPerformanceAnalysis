# StudentPerformanceAnalysis

## Project Description

The Student Performance Analysis Project is a data analysis initiative that aims to understand the factors that influence student performance. Through an exploratory approach, this project focuses on identifying patterns, correlations, and important insights that can be used to improve learning outcomes. The factors analysed include socioeconomic background, study habits, and parental involvement. The results of this analysis are expected to serve as a basis for more informed decision-making by educators, policymakers, and parents in efforts to improve the quality of education.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is ‘Students Performance Factors’ from Kaggle.

## Tools and Libraries

**Phython 3.12**

In the Student Performance Analysis project, various Python libraries were used to support the comprehensive data analysis process. **Pandas** was used for tabular data manipulation and processing, while **NumPy** supported efficient numerical calculations. For data visualisation, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used for informative static graphs, and **Plotly Express** was used for interactive visualisation. During the data preprocessing stage, the **StandardScaler** from scikit-learn is used for feature normalisation. Additionally, **SciPy** is employed for further statistical analysis. The combination of these libraries helps in uncovering patterns, correlations, and generating relevant insights into student performance.
